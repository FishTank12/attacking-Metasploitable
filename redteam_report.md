## Penetration Testing Report

### Scanning Phase

#### Nmap Scan

Using Nmap, we conducted a comprehensive scan with the following options:

- `-sV`: Detects versions of running services.
- `-sS`: Conducts a stealth SYN scan.
- `-O`: Attempts to identify the operating system.
- `-p-`: Scans all 65535 ports.
- `-A`: Performs OS detection and version detection, as well as running additional scripts.
- `-T4`: Increases the speed of the scan.

The results revealed multiple open ports, ranging from port 80 to port 8009, and identified the system as Linux Debian version 2.6.9-2.6.33. This scan also generated a TCP/IP fingerprint.

#### Nessus Vulnerability Scan

Using Nessus, we performed a more in-depth vulnerability scan on the target. Nessus provides a vulnerability report that includes critical, high, and medium severity vulnerabilities.

**Critical Vulnerabilities Found:**

1. **CVSS 10.0 - SSL 2.0/SSL 3.0 Support:**
   - These deprecated versions of SSL have several cryptographic flaws, including insecure padding schemes and session renegotiation vulnerabilities, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - **Solution:** Disable SSL 2.0/3.0 and use TLS 1.2 or higher.

2. **CVSS 10.0 - Bind Shell Backdoor:**
   - A bind shell is present on the target, allowing an attacker to connect to an open port and execute commands without authentication.
   - **Solution:** Verify if the system is compromised, and reinstall if necessary.

3. **CVSS 10.0 - VNC Weak Password:**
   - The VNC service is protected by the weak password "password." Nessus was able to authenticate using this password, granting potential full control to an attacker.
   - **Solution:** Secure VNC with a strong password.

**Medium Vulnerabilities Found:**

1. **Apache PHP-CGI Remote Code Execution:**
   - A vulnerability in PHP allows remote attackers to pass command-line arguments as part of a query string, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system crashes.

2. **phpMyAdmin Setup Script Vulnerability:**
   - The setup script does not sanitize user input, making the system vulnerable to code injection.

3. **Unencrypted Telnet Server:**
   - The target is running a Telnet server over an unencrypted channel, exposing the system to credential theft through man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - **Solution:** Disable Telnet and use SSH for secure communication.

### Exploits and Attack Paths

After the scanning phase, we selected four critical vulnerabilities for exploitation. These vulnerabilities demonstrate different ways of gaining access to the system, such as backdoors and RCE.

1. **Backdoor via Bind Shell:**
   - A bind shell was found open, which allowed us to gain shell access remotely. This backdoor provides a direct way to interact with the target system, bypassing authentication mechanisms.

2. **VNC Backdoor (Weak Password):**
   - Using the weak password discovered in Nessus, we successfully authenticated into the VNC service, providing full remote access to the system. This is another example of a backdoor into the system, where weak credentials create a critical vulnerability.

3. **SSL Downgrade Attack (POODLE):**
   - The systemâ€™s support for SSL 2.0/3.0 allowed us to exploit the POODLE vulnerability, downgrading the connection and potentially decrypting communications between the client and server.

4. **Apache PHP-CGI RCE:**
   - Using the vulnerability in the PHP installation, we performed remote code execution to run arbitrary commands on the system, demonstrating how poorly secured web applications can be exploited.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

In this red team engagement, we were able to identify and exploit several critical vulnerabilities, leading to complete system compromise. The most significant vulnerabilities were the bind shell and the weak VNC password, both of which provided easy backdoor access.

**Key Recommendations:**

- Disable SSL 2.0/3.0 and use only TLS 1.2 or higher.
- Strengthen passwords for services like VNC to prevent unauthorized access.
- Close unnecessary ports such as those used for the bind shell.
- Replace Telnet with SSH for secure remote access.
